In the middle of the town road is a frrrrreaakyy Hot Rod - you sure wouldn't want to be stopped by someone driving such a vehicle in the middle of the night, they're probably f#$%ing crazy! What are they gonna do? Pull a gun out on you and say \"Trick or Treat\"? Damn, I guess Dayton got tricked."

So what do we have here... Windows XP Notepad commenting over what is presumably an old YouTube video, an \"Unregistered HyperCam2\" watermark in the top left corner, and I can already hear that 009 sound system song playing over this. I really like the desaturation and subtle noise over the game window specifically... makes it a bit eerie, juxtaposed to the joke text written in the notepad..."
